After his death, all Ajay's family wanted to give him a full burial, but the hospital wouldn't release his body until all his treatment expenses were settled. The family had been in financial distress for a while, struggling to pay off the expenses. After much coaxing, Mark's body was released by the hospital, with the condition that all the expenses be settled by. 
<br/>
They needed Rs. 3,65,000 to clear the dues at the hospital. Watching them struggle to arrange the money, one of Ajay's friends reached out to the Pandey Kusum Foundation online platform. They received donations from different people, helping them meet their goal.  </p>

Little Shanmuka turned one in 2019. This is his first birthday, and he spent the day on a hospital bed with his worried parents, fighting (and winning) a major battle for life.<BR/>

It all began in February when Shanmuka began showing unusual symptoms for a boy his age. His skin turned a painful yellow and he would constantly cry in discomfort. His parents rushed him to the nearest hospital, expecting the doctor to diagnose him with jaundice. However, his condition was far worse than they'd imagined. <BR>At no more than 11 months old, with the help of Pandey Kusum Foundation, little Shanmuka was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, a condition where the liver is permanently damaged. Only a liver transplant could save him.

					Dheeraj, a young man from a middle-income family, couldn't have ever guessed that he would be able to get help for his father's treatment overnight!<BR/>

Dheeraj hails from India and works as an engineer in Bengaluru. His parents are humble vegetable vendors back in his hometown and his income helps sustain them.<BR/>

Unfortunately, in November 2018, his father suffered had an unexpected heart attack. On rushing him to the hospital, doctors found through an angiography test that he had three blockages in his heart and surgery was required immediately. When the hospital was inefficient in providing care, Dheeraj and his mother moved his father to a different hospital.<BR/>

Dheeraj knew his parents were in no place financially to be able to afford such a procedure. Determined to save his father's life, he turned to the Pandey Kusum Foundation for help. And did he make a hit of an emergency medical campaign! He managed to raise well over his predetermined goal amount of Rs 3 lakhs in less than one day, becoming an ideal example of an emergency medical campaign.
